Question/Reflection
What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that plain HTML, CSS, and JS does not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

One of the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has is the access to a database. By having access to a database, it keeps track of previous and udpated tasks that someone inputs. I can go into MongoDB and see what previous entries have been published (and/or updates). Another significant software concepts is that with the CRUD update, add, and delete options, it allows users who have access to my link to see what my changes are in real time. What this means is that as I, or someone who has my link, makes another task or edits another task or deletes a task, I am able to see the newest changes when I click open the link. By using all of these technologies, this link is not specific to just my local laptop/host but rather it updates accordingly.
